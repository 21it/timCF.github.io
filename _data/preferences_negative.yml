  note:   |
    I understand the great importance of imperative languages.
    I just do not like them.
    Mutable data and imperative constructions make high-level code more
    confusing and unobvious (especially in case of multithreading).

  note:   |
    I'm absolutely against the weak dynamic type system in programming languages.
    Yes, you can say that such languages accelerate the development process,
    but the quality of the code falls disproportionately.
    How many times have you seen stupid runtime errors like "undefined is not a function"?
    Or you need to remember how implicit type conversions work in JavaScript?

  title:  "JavaScript and NodeJS"
  note:   |
    JavaScript is really a bad language.
    Type system is weak and dynamic.
    Runtime system is single-threaded (concurrency in JS is not real multithreading).
    JS does not have a unified system of modules.
    JS does not have a unified structure of project.
    JS does not have a "normal" classes and OOP.
    JS does not have any types inference.
    JS does not have unified technology for working with asynchronous code.
    JS has absolutely mad NPM with very low-quality packages.

  note:   |
    Most GNU utilities do not work properly in Windows.
    Where is my bash?
    There is no normal package manager.
    Where is my apt-get / homebrew?
    I can not work properly in Windows.

  note:   |
    I think it's possible for some people that the scrum is working pretty well.
    But not for me.
    Scrum process and useless regular meetings make boredom and greatly slow me down.
    It seems that the scrum is working well when everything is going according to plan
    and the team is working with high rank professionals, but in reality this never happens.

    I just do not like the hot climate, it's physically hard for me.
