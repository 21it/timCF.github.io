  note:   |
    I understand the great importance of imperative languages.
    I just do not like them.
    Mutable data and imperative constructions make high-level code more
    confusing and unobvious (especially in case of multithreading).

  title:  "Weak dynamic types"
  note:   |
    I'm absolutely against the weak dynamic type system in programming languages.
    It is usually assumed that such languages accelerate the development process,
    but in reality the quality of the code falls disproportionately.
    Weak dynamic type system is the world of stupid runtime errors like
    "undefined is not a function" and unobvious implicit type conversions
    (like in JavaScript).

  title:  "JavaScript & NodeJS"
  note:   |
    JavaScript is my most unloved language.
    Type system is weak and dynamic.
    Runtime system is single-threaded (concurrency in JS is not real multithreading).
    JS does not have a unified system of modules.
    JS does not have a unified structure of project.
    JS does not have a "normal" classes and OOP.
    JS does not have any types inference.
    JS does not have unified technology for working with asynchronous code.
    JS has absolutely mad NPM with very low-quality packages.
    And finally this language is very popular,
    and this is the only language that works in web browsers so
    sooner or later you have to deal with it even if you do not want to.
    In spite of all of the above I'm pretty experienced in JS ecosystem -
    I have production experience in JavaScript, CoffeeScript, LiveScript,
    PureScript, Sass, Jade (Pug), React, React Native and many other
    libraries, languages and frameworks... And my experience suggests
    that it is better not to use these tools if there is another working alternative.

  note:   |
    Most GNU utilities do not work properly in Windows.
    Windows does not have normal package manager like apt-get or homebrew.
    UNIX operating systems are just much better suited for work.

  title:  "Scrum & bureaucracy"
  note:   |
    I think it's possible that for some people scrum is working pretty well.
    But not for me.
    Scrum process and useless regular meetings make boredom and greatly slow me down.
    It seems that the scrum is working well when everything is going according to plan
    and the team is working with high rank professionals, but in reality this never happens.

    I just do not like the hot climate, it's physically hard for me.
