  note:   |
    I like functional languages.
    The concept of immutable data
    greatly improves code readability and
    simplifies the development of multithreaded applications.

  title:  "Strong static types"
  note:   |
    For most of my career, I've worked with
    dynamically typed languages like Erlang and Elixir.
    BEAM Erlang VM, Erlang and Elixir languages, OTP and Phoenix
    frameworks are great tools to solve any kind of problem in
    telecommunications area. And I like to work with this toolset.
    But in my opinion this toolset is not perfect because of
    dynamic type system. Of course, static analysis tools like
    Dialyzer improve the situation, but not enough.
    Some time ago I began to study Haskell language
    and I really liked it. Safe, readable, predictable,
    simple source code and the most powerful type system ever.
    I'm not very experienced in the Haskell language,
    but I like Haskell and I'm very interested to use it more.

    Mac computer is superior and stylish hardware
    with modern enterprise UNIX software.
    Just works from the box. Perfect tool.

  title:  "Responsibility"
  note:   |
    Personal responsibility distinguishes a professional from a beginner in any field of activity,
    including software development.
    If a developer positions himself as a professional -
    only he is responsible for the code written by him.
    A professional can work alone on high-level tasks without
    a layer of managers between him and business side.
    A professional knows how to solve the problem properly without
    blurring the responsibilities between team members, management and business.
    If a professional needs something to solve a problem - he just gets it directly from the right people.
    The professional does not need external motivation because he always knows what he is doing and why.

  title:  "Individual"
  note:   |
    As a rule, I prefer an individual working principle to the command.
    It's not about sociofobia - it's about personal preferences and life principles.
    As experience shows when working individually, I show much higher results and get more pleasure from things I do.
    Of course I like to communicate and share experiences, I like teach people, but at a separate time.
    I really do not like being distracted while writing my code.

  title:  "Automated tests"
  note:   |
    I never commit uncovered / untested code. 100% test coverage is standard for my commercial projects.
    Automated tests greatly simplify future refactoring and other code changes.
    And of course it's nice to be sure that every line of code was called
    at least once and worked as expected.

  title:  "Documentation"
  note:   |
    I always write documentation of my projects.
    It is very important to formulate thoughts in the form of text starting from a technical task.
    I write technical documentation manually in markdown language and I deal with
    auto-generated (from source code) documentation as well.

  note:   |
    I like the northern nature. And I like the sea. I definitely like the northern European countries
    Norway, Sweden, Finland, Estonia and I dream about Iceland and Faroe Islands.
    Canada and the northern border of the United States also look good.
