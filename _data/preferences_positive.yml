    I like functional languages.
    The concept of immutable data
    greatly improves code readability and
    simplifies the development of multithreaded applications.

  title:  "Strong static types"
  note:   |
    For most of my career, I've worked with
    dynamically typed languages like Erlang and Elixir.
    BEAM Erlang VM, Erlang and Elixir languages, OTP and Phoenix
    frameworks are great tools to solve any kind of problem in
    telecommunications area. And I like to work with this toolset.
    But in my opinion this toolset is not perfect because of
    dynamic type system. Of course, static analysis tools like
    Dialyzer improve the situation, but not enough.
    Some time ago I began to study Haskell language
    and I really liked it. Safe, readable, predictable,
    simple source code and the most powerful type system ever.
    I'm not very experienced in the Haskell language,
    but I like Haskell and I'm very interested to use it more.
