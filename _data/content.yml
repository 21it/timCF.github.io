  Erlang, Elixir, OTP developer. Functional programming enthusiast.
summary_p1: |
  I have been programming since 2012.
  At the beginning I had some experience of development in imperative languages like C++ and JavaScript,
  but I did well only when I switched to functional languages like Erlang and Elixir.
summary_p2: |
  Today my main skill is functional backend programming
  and I'm strong expert in BEAM/Erlang VM platform, Erlang and Elixir languages.
  I have strong understanding of multithreading and interaction between Erlang processes.
  Of course in commercial development I'm using mainstream frameworks like OTP, Phoenix and Ecto.
summary_p3: |
  Future plans - to become more familiar with static-typed functional languages like Haskell.
  If static-typed languages for BEAM/Erlang VM like

  will be successful - I will be happy to switch.
