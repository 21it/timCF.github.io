  title: "Scalar blindness"
  description: |
    It’s mostly about common practice of scalar types overloading.
    I’ll explain by examples why this practice is bad and will show how
    to completely fix it with properly designed algebraic data types (in Haskell)
    and how to decrease this pain a little bit in Elixir with macro.
